# 🚗 Car Sales Analysis & Dashboard

## 📋 Project Description
This project focuses on the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a car advertisement dataset. The goal is to visualize market trends and provide an interactive tool for users to explore the relationship between vehicle attributes (like odometer and year) and their price.

The solution consists of a Jupyter Notebook for the initial deep-dive analysis and a web application built with **Streamlit** for public deployment.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Python** (Pandas)
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express (Interactive charts)
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **Deployment:** Render

## 📊 App Features
The web application offers the following interactive functionalities:
* **Odometer Analysis:** Generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of vehicle mileage across the dataset.
* **Price vs. Year Correlation:** A scatter plot to analyze how the vehicle's manufacturing year influences its market price.
* **Interactive Controls:** Users can trigger specific visualizations using simple UI buttons.
